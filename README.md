## Code Explanation

The code in this repository consists of several components:

1. **Data Preparation (data.csv)**:
   - The data.csv file contains the text data used for training the LSTM model.
   - It is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocessed before training.

2. **Model Training (train_model.py)**:
   - The train_model.py script constructs and trains an LSTM model using Keras and TensorFlow.
   - It prepares input-output pairs for training and compiles the model with appropriate loss and optimizer.
   - The trained model is saved to a file named mymodel.h5.

3. **Text Generation (generate_text.py)**:
   - The generate_text.py script provides functions to generate new text based on the trained LSTM model.
   - It includes functions to predict the next word given an input sequence and to generate text of specified length.

4. **Example Usage (Example)**:
   - An example of using the generate_text.py script is provided in the README.md file.
   - Users can import the generate_text function and use it to generate text with an initial input sequence.

5. **Dependencies**:
   - The code relies on various libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, pandas, and NLTK for data processing and model training.
   - These dependencies are not explicitly mentioned in the README.md to keep it concise.
